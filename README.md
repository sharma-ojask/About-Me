- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ojas Sharma, a 3rd year Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech. I have a passion for solving complex questions using my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, data modeling, and product lifecycle managment.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in opportunities in data analytics and visualization, data science, and product management.
- When I am not busy pursuing my career passions, I enjoy spending time cooking, practicing martial arts (I'm a 3rd Dan black belt in Taekwondo and Assistant Instructor), and playing basketball and ultimate frisbee. Also, hit me up anytime you want to go disc golfing!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me either through my email, sharma.ojask@gmail.com.
